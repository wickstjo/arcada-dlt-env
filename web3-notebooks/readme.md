## Web3 with Jupyter Notebooks (Python)
[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are an efficient method of developing Python applications. You can install temporary libraries directly in a notebook cell, and permanent libraries by including them in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/wickstjo/arcada-dlt-env/blob/master/web3-notebooks/docker/dockerfile) and rebuilding the container. The docker container mounts the [projects](https://github.com/wickstjo/arcada-dlt-env/tree/master/web3-notebooks/projects) directory so your notebooks aren’t deleted once the container is terminated.

By default, your notebooks will be available on **Port 8888**.

## Dependencies
Before starting with this repository, make sure that you have a functional [blockchain environment](https://github.com/wickstjo/arcada-dlt-env/tree/master/ganache-chain) running, and that you've compiled and uploaded the relevant [smart contracts](https://github.com/wickstjo/arcada-dlt-env/tree/master/truffle-contracts) there. Once that is done, run the [fetch-binary.sh](https://github.com/wickstjo/arcada-dlt-env/blob/master/web3-notebooks/fetch-binary.sh) script to copy over the produced [binary.json](https://github.com/wickstjo/arcada-dlt-env/blob/master/truffle-contracts/projects/example/binary.json) file to the example directory.

## Web3 Library
[The Web3 library](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is what allows the Python application to communicate with blockchain smart contracts through a gateway. It comes automatically installed with the container. However, many of the library methods are quite convoluted, particularly for beginners, so I wrote the [blockchain.ipynb](https://github.com/wickstjo/arcada-dlt-env/blob/master/web3-notebooks/projects/example/blockchain.ipynb) notebook to clarify the process of serializing a smart contract instance as well as reading existing and writing new data to the blockchain.

## Signing Transactions
Since the blockchain’s accounts are locked, transactions need to be signed using a public key’s corresponding private key in order to be considered valid. To simplify the signing process for the example project, these keys are listed in the [settings.json](https://github.com/wickstjo/arcada-dlt-env/blob/master/web3-notebooks/projects/example/resources/settings.json) file. Note that in a production scenario you should be using a more secure methodology for achieving this.
